1. Performance Boost: Used Grid Search CV to optimise hyperparameters, resulting an improvement in F1-Score compared to baseline models.

2. Robust Generalisation: Employed K-Fold CV (k=5) to enhance model accuracy by 4-5% on average across Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN algorithms.

3. Precision-Recall Optimisation: Achieved a 3-4% increase in precision and recall through hyperparameter tuning, ensuring a balanced trade-off.

4. Efficient Model Selection: Reduced model selection time by up to 30% with Grid Search CV, demonstrating proficiency in automated optimisation techniques and project efficiency.
